# Project Description: Bat Escape

## Main Character
The main character of the game is a bat named "Sombra". Sombra is a small, agile bat that has to navigate through various levels while escaping from a persistent ghost and collecting apples.

## Enemy
The primary enemy in the game is a ghost named "Phantom". Phantom is always chasing Sombra, and the player must use the bat's agility and speed to avoid getting caught.

## Levels
The game consists of multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty.

- **Level Progression:**
  - As the levels increase, Phantom's speed increases.
  - Sombra's speed decreases slightly with each new level.
  - The number of apples to collect increases by one for each level.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Movement:** The bat can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
  - **Keyboard Controls:**
    - `↑` (Up Arrow): Move up
    - `↓` (Down Arrow): Move down
    - `←` (Left Arrow): Move left
    - `→` (Right Arrow): Move right
  
- **Objective:** The primary objective of the game is to collect all the apples without being touched by the ghost, because it will kill you.

To pass to the next level, the player must:
1. Collect all apples scattered throughout the level.
2. Avoid getting caught by Phantom.
